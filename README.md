# 📩 Spam SMS Classification

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using Natural Language Processing techniques.

---

## 📌 Objective

To automatically detect and classify spam messages from regular ones, helping users avoid phishing, scams, and promotional overload.

---

## 🗂 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection)
- **Samples**: 5,574 labeled SMS messages
- **Labels**: `spam` or `ham`

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – Data handling
  - `nltk` – Text preprocessing
  - `scikit-learn` – ML models and evaluation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualizations

---

## 🔍 Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Lowercasing
   - Removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Tokenization
   - TF-IDF Vectorization

3. **Model Training**
   - Naive Bayes
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Logistic Regression

4. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - Confusion Matrix

---


## 💡 Highlights

- Achieved high accuracy with minimal feature engineering.
- TF-IDF improved model performance significantly.
- Easy to scale for email or chat moderation.
